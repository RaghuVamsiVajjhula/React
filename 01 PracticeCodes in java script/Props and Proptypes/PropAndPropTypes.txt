Basically props and its types are used to decalre some values.

Like asssume a situation we have a title given in the HTML code.
So now we replace it with some prop like titleProp so now the 
titleProp as a title value passes into the function.

 <a className="navbar-brand" href="/">{props.title}</a>

look at the navbar.png where we used the props now we declare the value of 
props.

The app.png is the place where the props are passes inside.


So basically we can change the value of the prop or uses the 
value present inside the prop in order to make some changes to our page.
so that we dont need to edit our code .

Proptypes: 
Here the value which we pass into the prop as a type can also be set into
some specific type like here we can set as a string type.

we can see that in proptypes.png

Also the props values which are needed to be export by default can also 
be set as seen in the image.
